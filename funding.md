Tip Jar

I have enough. To make a difference and give me a helpful nudge,

1. Read about the [Indian Residential School Survivors Society](https://www.irsss.ca/).
2. Make a [direct donation](https://www.irsss.ca/donate) in an amount of your choice.
3. Visit [Discussions](https://github.com/reinderien/xcalibrate/discussions).
4. Mention that you donated and let me know what you'd like in the project.

I can't promise that I'll implement your suggestion verbatim, as I have ideas about what the
project should and shouldn't be, but I do promise that I'll make an improvement of _some_
kind and work in your suggestions where they align with the project.
