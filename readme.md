_xinput_calibrator_ features precalibration, timeouts, misclick detection, fake driver testing, and
a resizable window.
_xcalibrate_ features none of those things, but offers some other features not present in
_xinput_calibrator_, including pre-save cal test, cal quality indicator, arbitrary cal point count,
and a slightly more informative GUI. Also, the source is quite simpler.

Why this?
=========

After I couldn't figure out why _xinput_calibrator_ wasn't doing anything on my system (an old
[CF-29](https://na.panasonic.com/us/computers-tablets/computers/laptops/toughbook-cf-29)),
I read and followed
[this excellent walkthrough](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Talk:Calibrating_Touchscreen#Libinput_breaks_xinput_calibrator)
on the Arch wiki. It was too hacky for my comfort, so I wrote this tool inspired by Zootboy's
procedure but with some key differences - this is a stand-alone tool that does not require running
_xinput_calibrator_; and it uses Numpy to do some real matrix math instead of hacking around with
element-by-element calculations and a fixed calibration dataset size.

How this?
=========

    ./xcalibrate

To do
=====

- Review some of the forks and issues logged
- Be more interactive in device selection
- Python 3 scrub
